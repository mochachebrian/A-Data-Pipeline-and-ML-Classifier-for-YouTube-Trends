Data analysis and machine learning project built on YouTube trending videos dataset.
The project walks through:

1. Loading raw CSV data into PostgreSQL

2. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. Training a Random Forest Classifier

4. Evaluating model performance with accuracy scores & classification reports

5. Visualizing feature importance
